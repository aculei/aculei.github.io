The Aculei initiative was developed with the goals of sharing an hunter-camera photo library, providing an interactive experience while discovering Umbria's biodiversity.

The idea for Aculei came from a Milanese photographer, Tobia Faverio, who set up a number of automated photo-traps in the Umbrian forests around his childhood home.
